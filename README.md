A Box2D port for the android platform

Compiling
=========

Run ./BuildDroid.sh from the Box2D folder. This should generate the .so file needed.

You can test by compiling the hello world the same way, then copy the .so(s) over to the Android folder and compile from there. You can then use logcat to see the output of the program.
